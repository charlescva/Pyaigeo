# Pyaigeo
LLM (AI) Generated Python with Geospatial Application: RF Propogation Simulation

Windows 10/11 CMD/Powershell:
```
git clone https://github.com/charlescva/Pyaigeo.git
python -m venv Pyaigeo
cd Pyaigeo
Scripts\activate.bat
python propagate.py
```

This code simulates RF (radio frequency) coverage over a randomly generated terrain using a digital elevation model (DEM):
![simulated_rf_coverage_map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557affcf-1d33-474b-9eb8-165b5422fcf5)

If you want to use a custom input elevation map, you can pass a TIF file as an argument to the `propagate.py` script:
```
python propagate.py Terrain_DEM.tif
```



**Imports and Setup:**
Libraries like rasterio, numpy, matplotlib, os, numba, and pyproj are imported for handling geospatial data, numerical computations, plotting, and performance optimization.

**Knife-Edge Diffraction Loss Calculation:**
The knife_edge_diffraction_loss function calculates the diffraction loss based on the distance, height of the obstacle, and wavelength.

**Antenna Gain Pattern:**
The antenna_gain_pattern function returns the gain of different types of antennas (dipole, directional, parabolic) based on the angle.

**RF Coverage Simulation:**
The simulate_rf_coverage function calculates the RF coverage by considering path loss, atmospheric loss, diffraction loss, and antenna gain. It uses the DEM data and transmitter parameters to compute the signal strength over the terrain.

**Diffraction Loss Calculation:**
The calculate_diffraction_loss function computes the terrain-based diffraction loss using a parallelized approach with numba.

**Coordinate Transformation:**
The latlon_to_rowcol function converts latitude and longitude to row and column indices in the DEM.

**Main Function:**
The main function reads the DEM data, sets up the transmitter parameters, and calls the simulate_rf_coverage function. It then plots and saves the RF coverage map.

**Key Points:**

**Performance Optimization:** The use of numba for JIT compilation and parallel processing speeds up the diffraction loss calculations.

Geospatial Handling: rasterio and pyproj are used for reading DEM data and transforming coordinates.

Visualization: matplotlib is used to plot the simulated RF coverage map.

**To improve this project and make it more realistic, consider the following improvements:**

Multipath Propagation:

Reflection, Diffraction, and Scattering: Include models for signal reflections off buildings, diffraction around obstacles, and scattering due to rough surfaces.
Ray Tracing: Implement ray tracing techniques to simulate the multiple paths a signal can take from the transmitter to the receiver.
Terrain and Vegetation Effects:

Clutter Models: Account for different types of terrain (urban, suburban, rural) and vegetation, which can attenuate the signal.
Foliage Loss: Include models for signal attenuation due to trees and other vegetation.
Atmospheric Conditions:

Weather Effects: Simulate the impact of weather conditions like rain, fog, and humidity on signal propagation.
Tropospheric and Ionospheric Effects: Consider the effects of the troposphere and ionosphere on signal bending and delay.
Antenna Characteristics:

Polarization: Include the effects of antenna polarization on signal strength and quality.
Antenna Radiation Patterns: Use more detailed and realistic antenna radiation patterns.
Interference and Noise:

Interference from Other Sources: Simulate interference from other transmitters and electronic devices.
Thermal Noise: Include thermal noise and other types of background noise in the simulation.
Advanced Path Loss Models:

Hata Model: Use the Hata model for urban, suburban, and rural areas.
Okumura Model: Implement the Okumura model for more detailed urban area simulations.
ITU-R Models: Use ITU-R models for various environments and frequencies.
Time Variability:

Temporal Changes: Simulate how signal strength varies over time due to factors like moving obstacles, changing weather, and varying traffic conditions.
User Mobility:

Mobile Receivers: Include models for receivers that are moving, such as in vehicles or carried by pedestrians.
Building Penetration:

Indoor Propagation: Simulate signal penetration into buildings and the effects of walls, floors, and other structures.
Frequency-Dependent Effects:

Frequency Selective Fading: Model how different frequencies experience different levels of fading and attenuation.
